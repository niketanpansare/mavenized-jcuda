{"name":"Mavenized JCuda","tagline":"Mavenized JCuda","body":"Mavenized JCuda\r\n============\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n* Currently support _JCuda 0.5.0, 0.5.5, 0.6.0RC_ (windows-i386, windows-x86_64), _0.6.0, 0.6.5_ (windows-i386, windows-x86_64, unix-x86_64, mac-x86_64)\r\n* Local Maven repo with 5 sets of native libs (windows-i386, windows-x86_64, unix-i386, unix-x86_64, mac-x86_64)\r\n* Auto detection of OS family name and it's architecture (it's choose needed dependencies automatically)\r\n* Running any main class, that contained JCuda code easily (without classpath hell, just run Maven goal)\r\n\r\nHow to run JCuda code:\r\n\r\n* You need to install Cuda (5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5) for your platform [here] [1]\r\n* Set property _<jcuda.version>_ in pom.xml to what you really use, e.g. 0.5.0 for Cuda 5.0, etc. (Cuda 6.5 - 0.6.5)\r\n    * If you run **JCuda 0.6.0RC** and higher on **Windows** platform everything is ok\r\n    * If you run **JCuda 0.5.5** and lower on **Windows** or **Unix** platform - you should set profile manually by adding *-P windows-x86_64_old*\r\n        or *-P windows-x86_old* or *-P unix-x86_64_old*, etc. to _mvn clean package_ command, depends on architecture you use.\r\n        For more info about **Maven** profiles take a look [here] [2]\r\n    * If you run **JCuda 0.6.0** and higher on **Unix x86_64** platform - everything is ok\r\n    * If you run **JCUda 0.6.0** and higher on **Mac x86_64** - everything is ok\r\n* Call _mvn clean package_ to build project (it will copy all dependencies to _target/lib_ dir)\r\n* Call _mvn exec:exec_ to run main class (org.mystic.cuda.JCudaRuntimeTest) with \"Hello, JCuda\" sample :)\r\n* If you want to run code directly from your IDE without **Maven** - you could do it via _Run_ command in most of the IDE (Intellij IDEA, Eclipse, Netbeans, etc.) All you need to do - is to add property _-Djava.library.path=target/lib_ (more information is on Stackoverflow - http://stackoverflow.com/q/28333226/2663985)\r\n* ???\r\n* Fork! Write your own JCuda code! Run! Report bugs!
